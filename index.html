  <p style="text-align: center;">
    Known on the internet as Ron Credible I am an up and coming web developer
    from Queens, NY. My two biggest interest are fashion and music. In fashion
    I pay a lot of attention to the "hypebeast" culture which has to do with
    exclusivity and knowing when to shop. As for music I listen to mostly
    Hip-Hop and R&B, on Apple Music I host a playlist that I update monthly
    with new music. I currently work at the YMCA as a Swim Instuctor
    and I also supervise a special needs camp during the summer,
    both positions I find very rewarding. In my free time I hold a
    position as a Label Executive at 2G Music Group, a buzzing Record Label
    in the New York City underground scene. This is where I display my
    creativity most whether it be assisting in writing songs, picking beats,
    co-directing videos, styling artist, and even hosting shows where I can
    display material to people who come out to watch. I am really into helping
    people and have an eye for detail and thats why I am entering this field,
    in order to have a hand in making others visions come to light online. </p>
